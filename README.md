# Hydroponics-Calculator
 "Hydroponic Plant Data GUI" script: PySimpleGUI + openpyxl. Analyze plant data from Excel, display in table, calculate TDS/EC, determine salts, interact with table. Perfect for hydroponics enthusiasts and researchers.

This Python script, titled "Hydroponic Plant Data GUI," is designed to provide a graphical user interface (GUI) for analyzing and calculating data related to hydroponic plants. The script utilizes the PySimpleGUI library to create the GUI and the openpyxl library to read data from an Excel file.

The main functionalities of the script include:

Loading plant data from an Excel file: The script reads plant data from a specific worksheet in the Excel file, capturing headers and individual plant data rows.

Displaying plant data: The GUI presents a table that displays the plant data fetched from the Excel file. The user can select a specific plant from a dropdown menu, and the corresponding data is populated in the table.

Calculating Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) and Electrical Conductivity (EC): Based on the selected plant data, the script calculates the TDS and EC values using predefined formulas. These values are displayed in the GUI for easy reference.

Calculating required salts: The user can input a volume (in mL) and click the "Calculate Salts" button to determine the amount of salts required for the selected plant and volume. The script performs the necessary calculations based on the plant's data and displays the results in a popup window.

Interacting with the plant data table: The script allows the user to interact with the plant data table by selecting individual cells. Upon cell selection, a popup window displays the row and column indices of the selected cell.

The script is designed to be user-friendly and provides valuable insights for individuals involved in hydroponic plant cultivation. It offers a convenient way to explore plant data, calculate essential parameters, and determine the required amounts of salts based on specific conditions.

The script can be useful for hydroponic enthusiasts, researchers, or professionals seeking an intuitive tool to analyze and manage plant data. It can be further customized and extended to accommodate additional functionalities or integrate with other hydroponic systems.

To run the script successfully, ensure that the PySimpleGUI and openpyxl libraries are installed in your Python environment. Additionally, make sure to provide the correct path to the Excel file containing the plant data.
